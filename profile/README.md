<summary>1. pair with a dedicated partner</summary>
We start by building a deeper understanding of the projects needs and the integration layer. A dedicated engineering lead will be assigned to be your partner from the start of a project.

<details>
<summary>2. Align and Iterate</summary>
Based on the understanding built together, our team will detail out the integration will entail and how we will go build it in the form of Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Engineering Requirement Document (ERD). We will align on the plan with you and iterate together on necessary areas before moving forward.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Implement</summary>
We go execute on the plan and build the implementation. We are able to move effectively, because of the plan and the alignment built in the prior step.

<details>
<summary>4. Support and Maintain</summary>
After completion of the deliverables, we remain available up to n weeks to make sure that the integrations works as expected and to support any unexpected issues that may arise.
